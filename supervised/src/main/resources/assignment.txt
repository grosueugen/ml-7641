I have chose 2 data sets with numeric attributes that show that the algorithms 
exhibit different performances.

1. Graphs
1.1. The time it takes for each classifier to run with different training data set sizes.
1.2. The time it takes for each classifier to run with different test data set sizes.

As per the instruction for decision tree, we don’t need to consider the information gain but need to mention 
(e.g. document in the analysis report) the other parameters (which we should vary) 
while finding the optimal algorithm. Is it a correct understanding?

yep, this was my understanding... and plot results for some different parameters
